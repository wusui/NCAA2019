After two rounds of play, there are 32,768 possible outcomes remaining in
the tournament. Assuming that each outcome is equally likely, the following
is a chart of the pool entries with the best chances to win. Any entry not
appearing on this chart has been mathematically eliminated from winning this
pool. This frequently happens when an entry is locked out from winning
by another entry that has more points and has made the same winning picks
as the trailing entry.
</p>
<p>
The Winning Outcomes column is the number of these 32,768 possible outcomes
that will result in this entry being in first place at the end of the
tournament. The Percentage column is the expected value of this entry if there
is only a payoff for first place and if ties split the payoff.  In other words,
it's 1 for a win, 1/2 for a tie with one other entry, 1/3 for a tie with two
other entries, and so on. This is to insure that the sum of all percentage
values is 1.
</p>
<p>
The remaining fields are the teams that this entry needs to have win
in the next round in order to still have a chance at winning this pool.
An asterisk indicates a game whose result will not affect the entry's standing
in any way.  A square that is white text on a black background is a MUST WIN
game.  If this result does not happen, then that entry is eliminated from
taking first in the pool.
</p>
<p>
The remaining fields contain a team and a background color that ranges from
bright green to bright red.  The color indicates how crucial the game is for
that entry.  For example, assume UCLA is playing USC.
if an entry has 500 winning possible outcomes if UCLA wins and
1 winning possible outcome if USC wins, then that field will contain
UCLA and have a bright red background. If the entry has 251 winning
possible outcomes if UCLA
wins and 250 winning possible outcomes if USC wins, then that field
will contain
UCLA and have a bright green background.
All other ratios will range linearally between green and red (orange is more
critical than yellow, yellow is more critical than yellow-green).  Any game
in the red to yellow range is pretty important.
